AutoOptimizer provides tools to automatically optimize machine learning model for a dataset with very little user intervention.

It refers to techniques that allow semi-sophisticated machine learning practitioners and non-experts 
to discover a good predictive model pipeline for their machine learning algorithm task quickly,
with very little intervention other than providing a dataset.


#Prerequisites:
